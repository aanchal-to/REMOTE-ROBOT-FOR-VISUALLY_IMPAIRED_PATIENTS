# REMOTE-ROBOT-FOR-VISUALLY_IMPAIRED_PATIENTS
Two projects described in this report demonstrate the potential of sensor technology to improve safety, independence, and efficiency in various contexts. The hat prototype with ultrasonic and haptic sensors
is a user-centered design approach that caters to the needs of visually impaired individuals, while the robot car prototype with ultrasonic sensors aims to transform the transportation
and logistics industry.
